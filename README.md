# Azure Service Models

IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are  three models of cloud computing services. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage over the internet. PaaS (Platform as a Service) offers a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers complete software applications over the internet, which users access on a subscription basis.

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

-   **What it is:** Provides access to fundamental computing resources like virtual machines, networks, and storage.
-  **What you manage:** The operating system, middleware, and applications.
-   **What the provider manages:** The underlying hardware, network, and physical data centers.
-   **Use case:** Companies that need a high degree of control over their infrastructure, similar to managing their own data center but without the physical hardware costs.
-   **Example:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (for core infrastructure services).
 
**PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

-   **What it is:** Provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications
-   **What you manage:** The applications and data.
-   **What the provider manages:** The operating systems, middleware, and hardware infrastructure.
-   **Use case:** Developers who want to build and deploy applications without worrying about server management or OS updates.
-   **Example:** Google App Engine.

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**

-   **What it is:** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
-   **What you manage:** Just the usage of the application.
-   **What the provider manages:** Everything, including the infrastructure, platform, and application.
-   **Use case:** End-users and businesses that need to access a software application without the need for installation, management, or upgrades.
-   **Example:** Dropbox, HubSpot, DocuSign.
